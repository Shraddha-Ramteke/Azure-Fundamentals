        "#Cloud Concepts\n",
        "Cloud is a collection of computers (mostly, physical servers) that are connected over the internet and are used to provide on-demand resources or services.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thousands of physical servers are housed in buildings known as Data Centres. Microsoft, an American Multinational corporation has Data centres in more than 130 countries all over the globe. Through these data centres, Microsoft provides the Azure Cloud Computing service.\n",
        "\n",
        "Azure offers resources and services for building, testing, deploying and managing applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Azure fundamentals is a six-part series that teaches you basic cloud concepts, provides a streamlined overview of many Azure services, and guides you with hands-on exercises to deploy your very first services for free.\n",
        "\n",
        "#After completing this learning path, you'll be able to:\n",
        "\n",
        "Understand the benefits of cloud computing in Azure and how it can save you time and money\n",
        "Explain cloud concepts such as high availability, scalability, elasticity, agility, and disaster recovery\n",
        "Describe core Azure architecture components such as subscriptions, management groups, resources and resource groups\n",
        "Summarize geographic distribution concepts such as Azure regions, region pairs, and availability zones\n",
        "Common Cloud Services\n",
        "Microsoft sorts Azure cloud services into nearly two dozen categories, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "#Compute\n",
        "These services enable a user to deploy and manage VMs, containers and batch jobs, as well as support remote application access. Compute resources created within the Azure cloud can be configured with either public IP addresses or private IP addresses, depending on whether the resource needs to be accessible to the outside world.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Mobile\n",
        "These products help developers build cloud applications for mobile devices, providing notification services, support for back-end tasks, tools for building application program interfaces (APIs) and the ability to couple geospatial context with data.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Web\n",
        "These services support the development and deployment of web applications. They also offer features for search, content delivery, API management, notification and reporting.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Storage\n",

        "\n",
        "#Containers\n",
        "These services help an enterprise create, register, orchestrate and manage huge volumes of containers in the Azure cloud, using common platforms such as Docker and Kubernetes.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Databases\n",
        "This category includes Database as a Service (DBaaS) offerings for SQL and NoSQL, as well as other database instances -- such as Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Database for PostgreSQL. It also includes Azure SQL Data Warehouse support, caching and hybrid database integration and migration features. Azure SQL is the platform's flagship database service. It is a relational database that provides SQL functionality without the need for deploying a SQL server.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Migration\n",
        "This suite of tools helps an organization estimate workload Migration costs and perform the actual migration of workloads from local data centers to the Azure cloud.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Management and governance\n",
        "These services provide a range of backup, recovery, compliance, automation, scheduling and monitoring tools that can help a cloud administrator manage an Azure deployment.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Mixed reality\n",

        "#Blockchain\n",
        "The Azure Blockchain Service allows you to join a blockchain consortium or to create your own.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Intune\n",
        "Microsoft Intune can be used to enroll user devices, thereby making it possible to push security policies and mobile apps to those devices. Mobile apps can be deployed either to groups of users or to a collection of devices. Intune also provides tools for tracking which apps are being used. A remote wipe feature allows the organization's data to be securely removed from devices without removing a user's mobile apps in the process.\n",
        "\n",
        "#There are three basic types of cloud services:\n",
        "\n",
        "The first is Saas, which stands for Software as a Service. This would be a software application that you could access over the cloud without having to have it installed on your device.\n",
        "\n",
        "PaaS stands for Platform as a Service. A service provider delivers a platform to you, enabling you to develop, run, and manage business applications over the cloud.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, Iaas, or Infrastructure as a Service is infrastructure delivered over the internet. This would be the actual data storage â€“ instead of maintaining servers and physical data centres, you can access all your data seamlessly though the cloud.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Software as a Service (SaaS)\n",
        "A variety of services are available as Software as a Service, including file storage, backup, web-based email and project management tools. Using one of these applications, users can access, share, store and secure information in the cloud. SaaS cloud solutions examples include Dropbox, Slack and Microsoft 365.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Platform as a Service (PaaS)\n",
        "Platform as a service is an environment in the cloud where developers can build and deploy apps. PaaS provides the database and operating system that is needed to develop cloud-based software. Developers can focus on their task, without needing to build and maintain the infrastructure that such software development processes normally require. AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Windows Azure are two cloud technology examples of PaaS.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)\n",
        "Infrastructure as a service provides the infrastructure that you need to manage SaaS tools, including servers, storage, and networking resources. The cloud provider would manage the storage servers and networking hardware and may also offer additional services like load balancing and firewalls.\n",
        "\n",
        "Common SaaS services include Dropbox, Salesforce, Cisco WebEx. PaaS services include Google App Engine, Apache Stratos and OpenShift. Some well-known IaaS services are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Cisco Metapod and Microsoft Azure. Many of these cloud computing service examples are already familiar to us all.\n",
        "\n",
        "#What is Microsoft and Azure\n",
        "Microsoft Azure, formerly known as Windows Azure, is Microsoft's public cloud computing platform. It provides a range of cloud services, including compute, analytics, storage and networking. Users can pick and choose from these services to develop and scale new applications, or run existing applications in the public cloud.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Azure platform aims to help businesses manage challenges and meet their organizational goals. It offers tools that support all industries -- including e-commerce, finance and a variety of Fortune 500 companies -- and is compatible with open source technologies. This provides users with the flexibility to use their preferred tools and technologies. In addition, Azure offers 4 different forms of cloud computing: infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), software as a service (SaaS) and serverless.\n",
        "\n",
        "Microsoft charges for Azure on a pay-as-you-go basis, meaning subscribers receive a bill each month that only charges them for the specific resources they have used.\n",

        "Types of Cloud Computing\n",
        "#Public Cloud\n",
        "If you use the public cloud model, you have all your hardware rented from Azure. It helps you cut costs and you can scale out your IT resources based on demand. You donâ€™t have to worry about maintaining your data centre or hardware, but you have limited control over your resources because you donâ€™t own anything and you have to depend on Microsoft for the security of your hardware or applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Private Cloud\n",
        "Also known as On-Premises Data centre. It is entirely dedicated to a single company. The company owns and maintains its private cloud. Resources can be used without the internet and the company has full control over everything. On the flip side, Capital expenses are huge.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Hybrid Cloud\n",
        "Most companies use the hybrid cloud strategy. It is a combination of the public cloud(like Azure) and the private cloud. The hybrid cloud model allows enterprises to deploy applications in private IT environments or public clouds and move between them. You can use the best features of a public cloud provider while storing sensitive information in your own data centres. This gives a business greater flexibility and more data deployment and security options. For a hybrid cloud to work, the data in your on-premises data centre must be compatible with the cloud providers. The downside of using a hybrid cloud is the complexity that arises when connecting servers of public cloud with private cloudâ€™s.\n",

        "#Evolution of Compute\n",
        "Dedicated Servers\n",
        "A dedicated server, or computing server, is a machine that allocates all of its hardware resources to the user. Unlike a virtual server, which allocates a portion of the resources to virtualisation technology, a dedicated server offers you all of its RAM, storage, and computing power. This technology can be applied to cloud computing, while dedicated servers are referred to as â€˜bare-metalâ€™. This type of solution emphasises the physical availability of the serverâ€™s hardware resources, in contrast to services based on virtual instances.There are two main factors that make a dedicated server different from a cloud instance. Firstly, the machine's raw performance is different: there is no virtualisation layer consuming resources on a dedicated server, so you are guaranteed full use of the physical resources. The second difference concerns the level of server administration. With a dedicated server, you manage everything from its configuration to the data hosted on it, and you are also responsible for ensuring that it is secure. This means you can opt for a more advanced installation, which is essential for the use of certain business applications (for example). The main benefit of a dedicated solution is the total freedom you get as an administrator.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Virtual Machines\n",
        "Virtual machines (VMs) are a technology for building virtualized computing environments. They have been around for quite a while and are considered the foundation of the first generation of cloud computing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Simply put, a virtual machine is an emulation of a physical computer. VMs enable teams to run what appear to be multiple machines, with multiple operating systems, on a single computer. VMs interact with physical computers by using lightweight software layers called hypervisors. Hypervisors can separate VMs from one another and allocate processors, memory, and storage among them.\n",
        "\n",
        "VMs are also known as virtual servers, virtual server instances and virtual private servers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Containers\n",
        "Containers are a lighter-weight, more agile way of handling virtualization â€” since they don't use a hypervisor, you can enjoy faster resource provisioning and speedier availability of new applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Rather than spinning up an entire virtual machine, containerization packages together everything needed to run a single application or microservice (along with runtime libraries they need to run). The container includes all the code, its dependencies and even the operating system itself. This enables applications to run almost anywhere â€” a desktop computer, a traditional IT infrastructure or the cloud.\n",
        "\n",
        "Containers use a form of operating system (OS) virtualization. Put simply, they leverage features of the host operating system to isolate processes and control the processesâ€™ access to CPUs, memory and desk space.\n",
        "\n",
        "Containers have been around for decades, but the common consensus is that the modern container era began in 2013 with the introduction of Docker, an open source platform for building, deploying and managing containerized applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Functions\n",
        "If you would like to simplify application development model where your application architecture has microservices that are more granular, such that various functionalities are reduced typically to a single function then, Azure functions can be considered for usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "In case, the solution needs some extension to existing azure application with event trigger based use cases , the azure functions can be better choice . Here, the specific code (function) shall be invoked only for specific event or trigger as per requirement and the function instances are created and destroyed on demand (compute on demand - function as a service (FaaS) ).\n",
        "\n",
        "More often, the event driven architecture is seen in IoT where typically you can define a specific trigger that causes execution of Azure function. Accordingly, Azure functions have its place in IoT ecosystem as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the solution has fast bursting and scaling requirement, then container Instances can be used whereas if the requirement is predictable scaling then, VMs can be used.\n",
        "\n",
        "Azure function avoids allocation of extra resources (VMs) and also the cost is considered only when the function is processing work. Here, we need not take care of infrastructure such as where the code is going to execute, server configuration, memory etc. For ACI, the cost is per-second where it is accounted based on the time the container runs - CaaS(Container As A Service).\n",
        "\n",
        "ACI enables for quickly spawning a container for performing the operation and deletion of it when done where the cost is only for few hours of usage rather than a dedicated VM which would be of high cost. ACI enables one to run a container by avoiding dependency on orchestrators like Kubernetes in scenarios where we would not need orchestration functions like service discovery, mesh and co-ordination features.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key difference is that, in case of Azure function, the function is the unit of work whereas in container instance, the entire container contains the unit of work. So, Azure functions start and end based on event triggers whereas the microservices in containers shall get executed the entire time.\n",
        "\n",
        "The processing / execution time also plays a critical role where if the event handler function consumes processing time of 10 minutes or more to execute, it is better to host in VM because the maximum timeout that is configurable for functions is 10 minutes.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Global Infrastructure\n",
        "\n",
        "Azure global infrastrcuture specific terms are like:\n",
        "\n",
        "Datacenters\n",
        "\n",
        "Regions\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "what%20are%20azure%20datacenters.png\n",
        "\n",
        "#Datacenters\n",
        "An Azure data center is a unique physical building that contains thousands of physical servers with it's own power, cooling and networking infrastructure. These data ceneters are located all over the globe. As of this course recording, there are over 160+ Azure datacenters. These dataceneters are organised into Azure Regions.\n",
        "\n",
        "#What is an Azure Geography\n",
        "An Azure geography is an area of the world that contains one or more Azure Regions. For example, India, United States, United Kingdom are a few examples of Azure Geographies.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Why are azure geographies important\n",
        "For two reasons: First, let's say all of your customers are in India. You don't want to host your application somewhere in the United States. You don't want every request and the associated data travelling around the world. This causes unnecessary latency, delay and hence, poor performance. You want your application and data to be hosted as geographically close to your customer base as possible. Since all our customers are in India, we want to make sure, our application and data is hosted in India. One way Azure ensures this is by using geographies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another reason is compliance with regulations. regulated data like financial, health care or credit card data may not be allowed to leave the country. Legally your organisation may be required to store such data in the same country where the operations are being carried out. Again, azure ensures this, by using geographies.\n",
        "\n",
        "#What is an Azure Region\n",
        "Simply put, an Azure Region is a set of Datacenters that are connected through a dedicated low-latency network. How many datacenters does a region contain. Well, we do not have a fixed number. It varies. There are regions of different sizes. A Region could be made up of just 1 dataceneter or multiple datacenters. The point is, an Azure Region is a group of one or more Azure Datacenters. As of this course recording, Azure has 58 regions worldwide.\n",
        "\n",
        "You have the flexibility to deploy your applications and data to any Azure region you want. You can even deploy across multiple regions to deliver cross-region resiliency.\n",
        "\n",
        "#What is cross-region resiliency\n",
        "Well, in general, resilience is the ability of a software to react to problems in one of its components and still provide the best possible service. Both your software and the underlying infrastructure must be resilient. If there is a problem, the end user should not know about it. The request must be handled and processed by another region. The end user should get the same level of service.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can get this resiliency, by deploying our application and data in at least 2 regions. In this example we have our application and data deployed in two regions - Region A and Region B.\n",
        "\n",
        "#What is an Azure Availability Zone\n",
        "An Azure Availability Zone is a unique physical location within an Azure region. Each Availability Zone is made up of one or more datacenters with independent power, cooling, and networking. Not all Regions have Availability Zones. Regions that support Availability Zones have a minimum of three separate zones to ensure resiliency.\n",
        "\n",
        "If one of the Availability Zones has gone down for some reason, we still have our applications and data available from the rest of the two Availability Zones. There is a physical separation between each Availability Zone and it is this separation that protects our applications and data from Datacenter failures. With Availability Zones, Azure offers industry best 99.99% VM uptime SLA.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Azure fault domain and update domain\n",
        "An Availability Zone is a combination of a fault domain and an update domain. For example, if you create three VMs across three zones in an Azure region, your VMs are effectively distributed across three fault domains and three update domains.\n",
        "\n",
        "For some reason, if there is a power failure or power surge, equipment failure or some other fault in Availability Zone 1, only Availability Zone 1 is affected. As the availability zones are physically separted from each other, faults from one availability zone are not spread to the other availability zones. Since, in this example, we have 3 availability zones, it's like we have 3 separate fault domains. If there is a fault and Availability Zone 1 is down, we still have our VM available from the rest of the two fault domians i.e Availability Zones 2 and 3. Similarly, if there is an update or a patch to be applied, azure schedules these at different times for different availability zones. So this means, we have just one of the availability zones affected while the update is being applied. The rest of the 2 zones are unaffected.\n",
        "\n",
        "In our example, since we have 3 availability zones, the updates will be applied at 3 different times. So even, if the VM from Availability Zone 1 is down, due to the update being applied, we have the rest of the 2 VMs still up and running i.e the VMs in Availability Zones 2 and 3.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Azure Zonal services and Zone-redundant services\n",
        "If you want to make the best use of availability zones and build high-availability systems, you will have to identify your compute, storage, networking, and data resources within an availability zone and replicate them in the other availability zones. Azure services that support Availability Zones are classified into two categories:\n",
        "\n",
        "#Zonal services\n",
        "Virtual machine is an example of a zonal service. A zonal service is pinned to a specific availability zone. This means it is only available in the availability zone where it is created. It is not automaically replicated to other availability zones. So, if want to build highly-available systems, identify zonal services, such as a VM for example and replicate them in other availability zones. Other examples of zonal services are managed disks and Standard IP addresses.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Zone-redundant services\n",

        "\n",
        "Azure regional pair, paired regions, or region pair, all these terms are used interchangeably and they refer to the same thing, i.e a pair of azure regions. So in simple terms, a regional pair consists of two regions within the same geography. As you can see from the image, at the highest level we have an Azure Geography. As we have already discussed, an Azure geography is an area of the world that contains one or more Azure Regions. For example, India, United States, Europe, Asia Pacific are a few examples of Azure Geographies.\n",
        "\n",
        "An azure region is made up of one or more datacenters. If availability zones are enabled, an azure region contains a minimum of three availability zones. An Availability Zone is made up of one or more datacenters. So the point is, an Azure region contains one or more datacenters or 3 or more availability zones if enabled. Most regions in a geography are paired to ensure business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR). The following are a few examples of azure paired regions. For the complete list of Azure paired regions, please check out the Microsoft official docs. A regional pair consists of two regions within the same geography. However, there is one exception to this. Brazil South region is paired with South Central US region, which obviously, is outside of Brazil's geography.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Benefits of paired regions\n",
        "#Physical separation between datacenters :\n",
        "When possible, there is at least 300 miles of separation between datacenters in a regional pair, although this isn't practical or possible in all geographies. Physical datacenter separation reduces the likelihood of natural disasters, civil unrest, power outages, or physical network outages affecting both the regions at the sametime. So for whatever reason, if one of the regions is down, we still have the other region available.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Region recovery in the event of an outage :\n",
        "If for whatever reason, several regions world-wide are down, azure prioritizes recovery of one region out of every pair. So if you want your apps and data to be highly available, deploy them in paired regions. With this setup, if both the regions are down, azure prioritizes to recover at least one region from the pair, so we have our apps and data available again soon. If applications are deployed across regions that are not paired, recovery might be delayed, in the worst case the chosen regions may be the last two to be recovered.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Automatic Platform-provided replication :\n",
        "Some services such as Geo-Redundant Storage provides automatic replication to the paired region. This is a great benefit. In an event, where one of the regions go down, you still have the data available from the other region in the region pair.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Data residency, compliance and legal requirements :\n",
        "With the exception of Brazil South, regions with in a region pair are from the same geography. This helps us meet data residency, compliance and legal requirements. Sequential system updates : From time to time, patches and software updates need to be applied. Regions in a region pair are never updated simultaneously at the same time. They are always applied sequentially. This reduces the downtime to a great extent. If the planned update contains any bugs or logical errors, only one region is affected. Our apps and data will still be available from the other region in the region pair.\n",

        "Improving operational efficiency. With RBAC, companies can decrease the need for paperwork and password changes when they hire new employees or switch the roles of existing employees. RBAC lets organizations quickly add and change roles, as well as implement them across platforms, operating systems (OSes) and applications. It also cuts down on the potential for error when assigning user permissions. Additionally, with RBAC, companies can more easily integrate third-party users into their networks by giving them predefined roles. Enhancing compliance. Every organization must comply with local, state and federal regulations. Companies generally prefer to implement RBAC systems to meet the regulatory and statutory requirements for confidentiality and privacy because executives and IT departments can more effectively manage how the data is accessed and used. This is particularly important for financial institutions and healthcare companies that manage sensitive data. Giving administrators increased visibility. RBAC gives network administrators and managers more visibility and oversight into the business, while also guaranteeing authorized users and guests on the system are only given access to what they need to do their jobs. Reducing costs. By not allowing user access to certain processes and applications, companies may conserve or more cost-effectively use resources, such as network bandwidth, memory and storage. Decreasing risk of breaches and data leakage. Implementing RBAC means restricting access to sensitive information, thus reducing the potential for data breaches or data leakage.\n",
